  Fixed.  See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18544890/onchange-event-on-input-type-range-is-not-triggering-in-firefox-while-dragging.

- Refactor javascript.  In particular, a new set of functions is created for each control; try to eliminate this as much as possible.
  Done.

- Refactor scss; add variables, check that all elements are correctly nested (e.g. .non-default-value may belong inside article, but outside div?).
  Done.

- Add comments to scss.
  Done.

- Try reducing browser window size to see how the page layout behaves (note: not attempting to be responsive at this time).

- Run html / css / javascript thru appropriate linters (add to build script?).

- Run Safari in native OS (i.e. not in a VM), open the debug window, refresh the page, and see if there is still an infinite loop (page never loads).

- Adjust page layout to look better on an iPad (font size, font family, increase width of example, add bottom margin to footer).
  Done.
