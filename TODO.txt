- Moving a scroll bar does not cause instant feedback in Firefox; changes only appear when the scroll bar is released.  Fix.
- Refactor javascript.  In particular, a new set of functions is created for each control; try to eliminate this as much as possible.
- Run Safari in native OS (i.e. not in a VM), open the debug window, refresh the page, and see if there is still an infinite loop (page never loads).
- Refactor scss; add variables, check that all elements are correctly nested (e.g. .non-default-value may belong inside article, but outside div?).
- Try reducing browser window size to see how the page layout behaves (note: not attempting to be responsive at this time).
- Add comments to scss.
- Run html / css / javascript thru appropriate linters (add to build script?).
